# Simple Long Task To UI

Sample Android Project that shows how to update UI from AsyncTask or Loopj tasks, using an Interface.

This project shows how to perform a long operation such as an http request, away from the UI thread,
and get the results back to the UI using a listener interface. The request is shown both using an 
AsyncTask and a library, Loopj in this case.
